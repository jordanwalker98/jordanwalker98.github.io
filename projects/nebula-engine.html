							<p>
								The Nebula Engine is a modern 3D game engine, written in C++ and powered by Vulkan, that is capable of rendering true-to-scale planetary
								environments. This is an ongoing personal project that I have worked on intermittently between the periods of 2018-2019 and 2022-present.
								I wrote the engine from scratch initially as a learning exercise that quickly grew into a more extensive hobby project that is very much
								still a work in progress. Most modern graphics/game engine techniques are implemented in this project such as deferred shading,
								physically based shading, compute shaders (GPGPU), realtime raytracing, and a framerate-independent game loop. The engine supports various quality-of-life features
								such as automatic shader compilation (HLSL->SPIR-V) and hot-reloading of shaders. On top of the core engine I have implemented a space-sim
								that allows the user to explore the major planets of the solar-system at 1:1 scale which I initially created in the Unity engine and have
								been gradually porting over.
							<p>
								There is a lot to discuss in relation to this project so more content, including screenshots, will be coming soon!
							</p>

							<h2 class="major">Graphics</h2>
							<p>
								The Nebula Engine uses the Vulkan API for rendering which allows for the implementation of realtime raytracing. Currently the engine supports
								deferred shading, physically based shading, atmospheric scattering and realtime raytracing. Having prior experience developing graphics pipelines, I found the graphics implementation
								to be fairly straightforward after creating the proper abstractions of Vulkan features; however creating the proper abstractions
								took some time to get right since I developed most of this part of the engine when Vulkan tutorials/resources were more sparse (2018) than they are today.
							<p>
								Probably the most challenging part of the graphics implementation was the shader compilation/reflection system. My initial system used a simple, custom parser and
								glslang to compile GLSL shaders into SPIR-V and reflect shader variables on the CPU-side but lacked hot reloading which turned out to slow down the iterative process of
								shader programming substantially - not to mention that most of the shaders I had written previously were in HLSL. After returning to the engine in 2022 I rewrote
								most (eventually all) of the engine's shaders in HLSL and now use ANTLR and DXC for parsing and reflection with manual handling of #include. This setup is much more
								stable and convenient and supports hot-reloading which is almost a necessity when working on procedural generation shaders that will be tweaked constantly.
							<p>
								As the engine supports realtime raytracing (currently only used for shadows) I decided not to implement techniques such as cascaded shadow maps or SSAO and plan
								to entirely rely on raytracing for these effects.

							<h2 class="major">Planetary-Scale Environments</h2>
							<p>
								While the task of representing and rendering planetary-scale environments may be tricky in most modern, commercially-available game engines,
								the Nebula engine was designed to do exactly this.
							<p>
								One of the most notable aspects of the engine is the use of a double precision coordinate system for world entities which is necessary to represent
								planetary-scale environments. Most game engines use single precision floats for coordinates which only has reasonable precision up to a few kilometers
								(at a  1 unit = 1 meter scale), beyond that range noticebale artifacts begin to appear such as jittering geometry vertices and physics errors; on a planetary
								scale, the quantization interval of coordinates becomes too large to represent the geometry of small objects such as a human. In order to get around this
								one could implement a floating origin - i.e. resetting the coordinates of the game world such that the camera/player is always close to the origin - however
								this ultimately involves explicitly maintaining two sets of coordinates, "true world" coordinates in double precision and "game world" coordinates in single precision,
								for each world entity which becomes cumbersome. A cleaner solution that is not available in most existing game engines is to double precision coordinates
								directly which Nebula implements. Of course doubles are generally slower on the CPU and much slower on the GPU so vector calculations with doubles
								are minimized as much as possible by using single precision relative coordinates. Rendering is done by computing the relative coordinates of world
								entities to the camera (to a similar effect as floating origin) every frame which is a simple vec3d difference then proceeding normally for the calculation of
								model matrices, etc.
							<p>
								In order to render planetary-scale environments in a single camera frustum, the near and far planes of the main camera must have a huge range
								with the near plane being a few centimeters away and the far plane being ~100k km away. If not accounted for this depth range will cause
								Z-testing to fail to due a lack of precision, however, by using either logarithmic depth or reversed-Z this problem can be alleviated. Initially
								I had implemented logarithmic depth but ultimately found reversed-Z to be a simpler and equally effective solution.
							</p>
							<h2 class="major">Procedural Space Sim</h2>
							<figure>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/nebula/Procedural.PNG" alt="" /><figcaption>Eroded craters on a procedural world.</figcaption></span>
							</figure>
							<p>
								On top of the engine I am building a space simulator that will eventually allow the user to explore a 1:1 procedural, virtual Milky Way similar to SpaceEngine.
								Currently I have implemented a procedural planet system that can use a mix of real and procedural heightmaps to render the major planets of the solar system or
								entirely procedural worlds.
							<p>
								Currently the space sim features the solar system + the ~100k real-world stars listed in the Hipparcos Star catalog and allows the user to search stars from the catalog
								via either its HIP id, HD number or Bayer designation or and warp to them.
							<p>
								In an effort to generate more physically plausible results than the common methods of using procedural noise
								I implemented an algorithm for simulating hydraulic and thermal erosion on infinite terrain in realtime via the GPU
								(will be showcased in a separate project - coming soon!) that can generate somewhat realistic mountains/erosion effects on procedural worlds by
								taking advantage of the fractal nature of the quadtree-LOD system.
							<p>
								Additionally I implemented a planetary system generation algorithm that incorporates some astrophysical principles to generate plausible results.
								A general overview of the algorithm is as follows:
								<ol>
									<li>
										calculate the amount of mass in the parent star's protoplanetary disk, 98% of this will be gas the rest will be dust or ice (that can accrete into solid cores),
										this will act as a "mass budget" for generating new planets
									</li>
									<li>
										sampling from an exponentional distribution, calculate the semi-major axis (SMA) of a new planet core from the parent star (cores are more likely to form closer to the star)
									</li>
									<li>
										randomly calculate the mass of the core depending on whether or not it is within the parent star's frost line (cores will tend to be more massive beyond the frost
										line as they can accrete rock and ice) and subtract this from the mass budget
									</li>
									<li>
										if the core mass is greater than 10 Earth masses we assume the core can accrete hydrogen gas in the protoplanetary disk and may become a gas or ice giant,
										we calculate its new mass based on the core mass and the density of gas in the disk at its SMA
									</li>
									<li>
										once the mass budget is depleted and planet generation is finished, some planets may be within each others' hill radii, we assume these planets will collide and merge them
									</li>
									<li>
										for each planet:
										<ol type="i">
											<li>
												calculate additional intrinsic parameters such as density, surface gravity, etc.
											</li>
											<li>
												estimate the core cooling time for rocky planets (this determines how long the planet will be geologically active which affects both terrain formation and atmospheric composition/density due to outgassing)
											</li>
											<li>
												estimate the atmospheric conditions (i.e. density and temperatue) of the planet's early atmosphere
											</li>
											<li>
												extrapolate from early conditions (e.g. would liquid oceans have frozen or evapored, could life have developed and survived?) to current atmospheric conditions - planets
												within the parent star's habitable zone may become Venus-like and planets seemingly outside the habitable zone may be able to support liquid water due to dense, warm atmospheres
											</li>
											<li>
												generate planetary terrain and atmosphere model for rendering
											</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ol>

								While this algorithm does not account for many phenoma such as planetary migration or the effect of orbital resonances, etc. it is capable of some plausible results and
								of recreating some of the types of worlds observable in our solar system and among expolanets in other star systems including temperate Earth-like worlds, hot jupiters and super-Earths.
